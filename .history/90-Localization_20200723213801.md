Localization has been added in 3.1.1

This description refers to all the filters which are shipped with the mod.

* All language localization files are in the folder:  000_FilterExtensions/Lang
* There is currently only one language shipped, translations will be gratefully accepted
* The localization IDs all begin with the letters **fe_**
* The order of IDs doesn't matter, but it makes it easier if translations would use the same groupings as what is already there.
* The IDs are grouped together in relevant groups, comments will, when the localization work is finalized, describe what each block is used for.
* In the category and sub category nodes, the **name** field needs to be localized
* In the subcategory lists, the second field for each list line is a localized id
* For **FilterSetIcon **groups, the first field is a localized ID
